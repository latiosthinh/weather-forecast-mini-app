# TypeScript & Code Quality

**15. How does TypeScript improve the reliability of this project?**

*Answer:* TypeScript provides static type checking, catching errors at compile time, improving code reliability and maintainability.

**16. How do you type API responses and component props?**

*Answer:* Define TypeScript interfaces or types for API responses and props. Use these types in function signatures and component definitions to ensure type safety.

**17. What strategies do you use to avoid type duplication between frontend and backend?**

*Answer:* Share type definitions in a common package or directory, or generate types from API schemas (e.g., using OpenAPI or GraphQL codegen).

**18. How do you handle optional and nullable types in your components?**

*Answer:* Use TypeScript's `?` for optional props and `| null` for nullable values. Handle these cases explicitly in the component logic.
