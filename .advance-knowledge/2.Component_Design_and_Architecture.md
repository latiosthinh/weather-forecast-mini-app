# Component Design & Architecture

**6. How do you structure your components for reusability and scalability?**

*Answer:* Components are organized by feature or domain (e.g., `main-city`, `sidebar`). Shared components are placed in a common directory. Each component is designed to be as independent and reusable as possible, with clear props and minimal dependencies.

**7. What is the purpose of the `main-city` and `sidebar` component folders? How do you decide when to split components into subfolders?**

*Answer:* These folders group related components by feature, improving maintainability. Components are split into subfolders when they represent distinct features or UI sections, or when a folder grows too large.

**8. How would you handle prop drilling in a deeply nested component tree?**

*Answer:* Prop drilling can be avoided by using React Context, state management libraries, or custom hooks to provide data to deeply nested components without passing props through every level.

**9. What are controlled vs uncontrolled components? Where would you use each in this project?**

*Answer:* Controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components manage their own state internally. Controlled components are preferred for forms and inputs where you need to react to user input, such as the search bar.

**Example: Controlled Component (Search Bar)**

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const ControlledSearchBar = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={handleChange}
      placeholder="Search city..."
    />
  );
};
```

**Example: Uncontrolled Component (Search Bar)**

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";

const UncontrolledSearchBar = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const handleSearch = () => {
    alert("Searching for: " + inputRef.current?.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        ref={inputRef}
        placeholder="Search city..."
      />
      <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**10. How do you ensure accessibility (a11y) in your components?**

*Answer:* Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and test with screen readers. Components should be accessible by default and tested for a11y compliance.
