# State Management

**11. How is state managed in this project? Why did you choose the current approach (e.g., context, Zustand, Redux, etc.)?**

*Answer:* State is managed using React Context or a state management library like Zustand. The choice depends on the complexity and sharing needs of the state. For global state (e.g., selected city), a store is used; for local state, React's useState suffices.

**12. How would you handle global state vs local state?**

*Answer:* Global state (shared across many components) is managed with a store or context. Local state (specific to a component) is managed with useState or useReducer within that component.

**13. How do you persist user settings or selected cities across sessions?**

*Answer:* Use localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies to persist data. On app load, initialize state from storage if available.

**14. What are the trade-offs between using React Context and a state management library like Redux or Zustand?**

*Answer:* Context is simple and built-in but can cause unnecessary re-renders for large state. Libraries like Redux or Zustand offer better performance and features for complex state, but add dependencies and boilerplate.
