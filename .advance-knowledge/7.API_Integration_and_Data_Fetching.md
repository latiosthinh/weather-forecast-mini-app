# API Integration & Data Fetching

**27. How do you handle API errors and loading states in the UI?**

*Answer:* Use state variables to track loading and error states. Show spinners or error messages as appropriate.

**28. How would you implement caching for weather data?**

*Answer:* Use SWR, React Query, or a custom cache to store fetched data and avoid unnecessary requests.

**29. How do you secure API keys or sensitive data in a Next.js project?**

*Answer:* Store secrets in environment variables and never expose them to the client. Use server-side API routes to proxy requests if needed.

**30. How do you handle rate limiting or API quota issues from the weather provider?**

*Answer:* Implement retry logic, exponential backoff, and show user-friendly error messages. Cache responses to reduce API calls.
