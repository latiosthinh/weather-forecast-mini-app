# React & Next.js Fundamentals

**1. How does Next.js differ from Create React App? Why might you choose Next.js for this project?**

*Answer:* Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and file-based routing out of the box, while Create React App is focused on client-side rendering only. Next.js is chosen for this project to leverage SSR/SSG for better SEO and performance, and to use built-in API routes for backend logic.

**2. Explain the difference between server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR) in Next.js. Which does this project use and why?**

*Answer:* SSR renders pages on each request, SSG pre-renders at build time, and CSR renders in the browser. This project likely uses SSR or SSG for weather data to improve load times and SEO, while some parts may use CSR for dynamic updates.

**3. How are API routes handled in Next.js? Can you walk through the flow of a request to `/api/get-weather-data/route.ts`?**

*Answer:* API routes in Next.js are files under the `pages/api` or `app/api` directory. A request to `/api/get-weather-data/route.ts` is handled by the exported handler in that file, which processes the request and returns a response, similar to an Express route.

**4. What are React hooks? Which custom hooks would you consider creating for this project and why?**

*Answer:* React hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Custom hooks could be created for fetching weather data, managing user preferences, or handling debounced search input.

**Example: Custom Hook for Debounced Search Input**

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

/**
 * useDebouncedValue
 * @param value The value to debounce
 * @param delay The debounce delay in milliseconds
 * @returns The debounced value
 */
export function useDebouncedValue<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Cleanup timeout if value or delay changes, or on unmount
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}
```

**Usage Example in a Search Component**

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDebouncedValue } from "./useDebouncedValue";

const SearchBar = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const debouncedInput = useDebouncedValue(input, 500); // 500ms debounce

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedInput) {
      // fetch or filter logic here
      console.log("Searching for:", debouncedInput);
    }
  }, [debouncedInput]);

  return (
    <input
      value={input}
      onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search city..."
    />
  );
};
```

**5. How do you manage side effects in React components? Give an example from this project.**

*Answer:* Side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of the current function, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. In React, side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook. For example, fetching weather data when a city is selected would be done inside a `useEffect` that depends on the selected city.
