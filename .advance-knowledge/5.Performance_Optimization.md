# Performance Optimization

**19. How do you optimize rendering performance in React?**

*Answer:* Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Split large components, and avoid passing new object/array references as props unless needed.

**20. What tools or techniques would you use to profile and fix performance bottlenecks in this app?**

*Answer:* Use React DevTools Profiler, Chrome DevTools, and Lighthouse to identify slow components and optimize them. Analyze re-renders and network requests.

**21. How do you implement code splitting in Next.js?**

*Answer:* Next.js automatically code splits pages. For components, use dynamic imports with `next/dynamic` to load them only when needed.
